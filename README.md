A lightweight Bedrock resource pack focused on higher performance with minimal visual distractions. It removes or simplifies effects (particles, environment textures, animated textures, fog/flipbooks, etc.) so you can get smoother gameplay on low-end devices.

This project is not affiliated with Mojang, Microsoft, or Minecraft.
